Git copy of the PROFILE package, used for simulating AMI observations (amongst other things).

This software currently only works on the Cavendish machines due to external dependencies.  Versions for Solaris and Linux are built by, e.g.:

  mraosa> make -f Makefile.sun clean
  mraosa> make -f Makefile.sun

  appcs> make -f Makefile.linux clean
  appcs> make -f Makefile.linux

The executables end up as profile.[sun,linux] in this directory.  The commands 'help', 'explain-profile', and 'explain-command' will give you (some) help.
